# Shoebox Boilerplate

> A "simple" boilerplate for simple projects

This fwas forked from the more complex [Kratos Boilerplate](https://github.com/LFeh/kratos-boilerplate), simplified to what I need and Bootstrap added for prototypey things. 


## Getting Started

```sh
# install dependencies
$ npm i

# Run the project
$ npm start
```

With the commands above, you have everything to start.

The `app.config.json` file has all minimal config to create your scaffolding.

## Tasks

- `npm start`: run all tasks and initialize watch for changes and a server
- `npm run build`: run all production tasks create a `dist` folder to deploy
- `npm run lint`: lint javascript and css
- `npm run fix`: command to fix all eslint errors
